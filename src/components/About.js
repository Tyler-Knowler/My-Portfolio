                <span><p>I'm Tyler, a beginner in Web Development, trying to figure out how this stuff works :)</p>
                <p>I currently work as a Residential Support Worker and previously as a Learning Support Worker. I learnt a lot while working in these positions and I enjoyed them thoroughly, however, I have always had a passion for computers and I want to begin a career in Web Development.</p>
                <p>I wanted to make this page as I wanted to learn how to use Node.js and React. So I thought, what better way than to make a website myself where I can display some of the different projects I've made on this journey.</p>
                <p>My goal for this is to imrpove my skills in web development and to display what I'm capable of doing.</p></span>
